#summary Summer 2008 Projects, GSoC and otherwise

Hackystat has four students participating in the [http://code.google.com/soc/2008/ 2008 Google Summer of Code].  As part of their responsibilities, the students will be keeping a blog and updating it once a week to summarize their progress, current issues, future plans, and anything else of interest.  This page provides links to these student projects, their associated blogs, and the day of the week when they will provide a weekly status report entry.  The [http://code.google.com/soc/2008/hackystat/about.html project proposals] provide information about the goals of the projects.
