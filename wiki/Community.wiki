#summary Examples of Hackystat usage by the software development community

Since 2001, Hackystat has been used by a variety of research and industrial organizations to better understand software development.  Here are some examples of the way in which Hackystat has been applied. 

|| *Organization*  || *Collaborators* || *Description* ||
|| [http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/SoftEng/ESEG/ University of Maryland,  Experimental Software Engineering Group] || Victor Basili, Marvin Zelkowitz || Performed a variety of experiments on programmer productivity as part of the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/SoftEng/ESEG/hpcs/ HPCS Development Time Working Group].  Used Hackystat to record developer activities within editors and at the command line, and integrated Hackystat into their UMDInst toolset.  Example publication: [http://hpcs.cs.umd.edu/fileadmin/papers/fse-esec05.pdf Combining Self-reported and Automatic Data to Improve Programming Effort Measurement], Lorin Hochstein, Victor R. Basili, Marvin V. Zelkowitz, Jeffrey K. Hollingsworth, Jeffrey Carver, Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE05), 2005. ||
|| Sun Microsystems,  HPCS Productity Team || Larry Votta, Michael Van De Vanter, Susan Squires || Performed research to understand productivity issues in high performance computing systems as part of the DARPA HPCS program.  Investigated integration of qualitative data collected manually through programmer diaries with quantitative data collected automatically by Hackystat. Example publication: [http://www.ctwatch.org/quarterly/articles/2006/11/software-productivity-research-in-high-performance-computing/ Software Productivity Research in High Performance Computing], Susan Squires, Michael Van De Vanter, Lawrence Votta, CTWatch Quarterly, November, 2006. ||
|| [http://www.sintef.no SINTEF], Information and Communication Technology Division || Geir Hanssen || Performed a pilot case study on the use of the Zorro system to support technology transfer and adoption of Test Driven Design practices. (No publication available yet.) ||
|| [http://www.6thsenseanalytics.com/ 6th Sense Analytics] || Todd Olson, Greg Burnell || Used Hackystat as a technology basis for a commercial offering involving sensor-based acquisition of software developer behaviors.
