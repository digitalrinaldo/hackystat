#summary Strategies for diagnosing sensor data transmission problems.

== 1.0 Introduction ==

Sometimes sensor data is not transmitted efficiently or effectively from sensors to the sensorbase.  The goal of this page is to provide strategies for diagnosing problems if they occur and resolving them. 

At a high level, transmission problems have only three possible causes:
  * The !SensorBase server process is not responsive.
  * The sensor client process is not responsive.
  * The network is not responsive. 

Some of the most likely reasons for a !SensorBase server process to be unresponsive include:
  * The server process does not have adequate heap space.
  * The server is under too heavy a load. 
  * The database implementation for the server is configured or implemented incorrectly.

Some of the most likely reasons for a sensor client process to be unresponsive include:
  * The client process does not have adequate heap space. 
  * The client is configured or implemented incorrectly.

Some of the most likely reasons for a network to be unresponsive include:
  * Firewall issues. 

The goal of this document is to provide some strategies that enable you as a Hackystat installer to isolate where problems are occurring and what you might want to do about them. 

== 2.0 Diagnosis strategies ==

=== 2.1 The minimalist configuration: Setup and invocation ===

If you are experiencing sensor data transmission problems, it is helpful to begin your diagnosis process by seeing if a minimal sensor data transmission scenario also displays the problems. If you can get a minimalist configuration to work reliably, it is much easier to proceed with the diagnosis. 

Our recommendation for a minimalist sensor data transmission scenario is as follows:


First, use the default embedded Derby database implementation.  This eliminates code specific to your particular databaseimplementation.  The default embedded Derby database implementation is relatively high performance.  Be sure that:
  * You are allocating at least 256M of memory for heap.  The Java default of 64M is a known cause of sensor data transmission problems. 
  * The logging level is set to INFO.  Setting the logging level to ALL or FINE is a known cause of transmission problems under heavy loads. 

Second, use [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-shell/wiki/ShellPerfEval ShellPerfEval] as the "sensor".  This eliminates code specific to a particular sensor implementation.  Provide the following settings in the sensorshell.properties file read in by !ShellPerfEval:
{{{
sensorshell.multishell.enabled = true
sensorshell.timeout = 200
sensorshell.timeout.ping = 200
sensorshell.multishell.numshells = 1
sensorshell.multishell.batchsize = 31
sensorshell.multishell.maxbuffer = 32
}}}

The effect of these settings is to "throttle" the client-side transmission at a relatively low level: only one thread will be sending requests, each request will contain only 32 sensor data instances, and the client will wait up to 200 seconds before timing out. 

You should also provide the client with at least 256M of heap space. 

To test this scenario, bring up your test sensorbase as follows:

                sensorbase.admin.password = admin@hackystat.org
                sensorbase.db.dir = C:\Documents and Settings\johnson/.hackystat/sensorbase/db
                sensorbase.xml.dir = C:\hackystat-projects\hackystat-sensorbase-uh/xml
                sensorbase.db.impl = org.hackystat.sensorbase.db.derby.DerbyImplementation
                sensorbase.logging.level = INFO

03/12 14:30:33  SensorBase (Version 8.x.311) now running.
}}}

Note that the server prints out the maximum Java heap size it has available. You can use this to check that you have specified the heap size correctly.

Now, in a separate console window, run your !ShellPerfEval.  The following run shows transmission of only 2000 instances, but you will typically want to send a higher number, such as 50,000 or 100,000.

This output shows a normal, correctly functioning mimimalist configuration.  There are 31 zeros in a row, which represent the queuing of sensor data instances locally which thus takes 0 milliseconds to complete, followed by a number between about 200 and 500, representing the number of milliseconds required to send these 32 instances from the client to the server.
Besides this output, it is also useful to look at the log file in ~/.hackystat/sensorshell/logs.  When multi-shell mode is enabled, the !SensorShell will generate a separate log file for each interior shell for each run.  It does this by generating a timestamp for each run and appending a number to uniquely identify each of the shells.  

In the case above, we specified only 1 shell, so only one file will be generated, which in this case was called "ShellPerfEval-1205368657335--0.0.log".  If 2 shells had been specified, then the other shell's logging output would have been in a file called "ShellPerfEval-1205368657335--1.0.log".  

Here is the beginning and ending contents of the file: ShellPerfEval-1205368657335--0.0.log:

Note that this log file also specifies what heap size the client had available (at 14:37:37), which enables you to double check that the heap size has been increased correctly.  It also prints out the remaining heap size as transmission proceeds, which in this case does not change at all.
