#summary Links to Hackystat services.

The Hackystat Framework consists of a set of services, each implemented and maintained in its own Google Project Hosting project. This page provides a directory of all of the projects with our participation.  To aid in understanding, we divide the projects into several categories based upon their key functionality.

== Core Services ==

These projects provide the sensor data repository and helpful utilities. 

|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/ SensorBase-UH] || The repository for raw data which provides four core resource representations: Sensor Data, Sensor Data Type, Project, and User. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-utilities/ Utilities]  || A library of utility classes used by many modules. ||


== User Interface Services ==

These projects provide end-user interfaces. 

|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-sensordataviewer/ Sensor Data Viewer] || Shows recently arrived data in near-real time. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-sensordatabrowser/ Sensor Data Browser] || Provides a browser for sensor data. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-telemetryviewer/ Telemetry Viewer] || Provides a visualization of telemetry data. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-projectviewer/ Project Viewer] || Provides an interface to Project definition and management. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-systemstatus/ System Status] || Tools for monitoring a Hackystat installation. ||

== Sensors ==

These projects support sensors, or small software plugins that collect data from development tools and send it to the !SensorBase.

|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-shell/ Sensor Shell] || The "middleware" abstraction that encapsulates details of data transmission, data buffering, and offline storage. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-ant/ Ant-based Sensors] || Sensors for tools such as Clover, JUnit, Checkstyle, FindBugs, PMD, and Ant itself. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-emacs/ Emacs Sensor] ||  A sensor for the Emacs IDE. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-vim/ Vim Sensor] || A sensor for the Vim IDE. || 
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-eclipse/ Eclipse Sensor] || A sensor for the Eclipse IDE. || 
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-xmldata/ XML Data Sensor] || A generic sensor for processing data in XML format. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensor-example/ StackyHack] || An example system showing implementations of various Ant-based sensors.  ||

 
== Analysis Services ==

These projects take data from the !SensorBase (and/or other Analysis Services) and generate higher level abstractions. 

|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-analysis-dailyprojectdata/ Daily Project Data] || Provides abstractions of raw data for a given project and day. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-analysis-telemetry/ Telemetry] || Provides a trend-based abstraction called "Software Project Telemetry" based upon the Daily Project Data abstraction. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-analysis-sdsa/ SDSA] || Provides an episode-based abstraction called "Software Development Stream Analysis". ||


== Experimental Services ==

These projects are not yet ready for primetime. 

|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-chart/ Chart] || An unreleased service based upon JFreeChart. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-ui-timeline/ Timeline] || An unreleased service based upon Simile/Timeline. ||
