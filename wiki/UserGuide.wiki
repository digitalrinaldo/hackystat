= Introduction =

This page provides a guide to installing Hackystat from a "System Distribution" found in the [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat/downloads/list Downloads] area of this Google Project.  

A Hackystat "System Distribution" consists of a set of zip files with a common version number. Together, they provide a snapshot of all releasable Hackystat sensors and services built at one time and tested against each other whenever possible. It is possible to download and install individual Hackystat sensors and services by going to their individual Google Project Hosting pages, but most users (and developers) will find it more convenient and less failure-prone to download the most recent System Distribution and use that as the basis for their activities. 

= Structure of the System Distribution =

Currently, a Hackystat System distribution consists of four zip files. For example, the November 1, 2007 System Distribution consists of the following files:

|| *File Name* || *Contents* ||
|| hackystat-8.0.1101-sensors-bin.zip  || Binaries for the (client side) Hackystat sensors ||
|| hackystat-8.0.1101-services-bin.zip || Binaries for the (server side) Hackystat services ||
|| hackystat-8.0.1101-sensors-src.zip  || Sources for the (client side) Hackystat sensors ||
|| hackystat-8.0.1101-services-src.zip || Sources for the (service side) Hackystat services ||

Normally, you are only interested in the "bin" zip files.  The "src" files are provided in case you experience a problem when installing the binaries and need to diagnose the problem by rebuilding the system from sources locally. 

The binary distributions expand into a top-level directory with the same name as the file (except for the .zip suffix), with a subdirectory for each sensor or service contained within the distribution. For example:

{{{
hackystat-8.0.1101-sensors-bin/
                              README.html
                              hackystat-sensor-ant/
                                                   antsensors.jar
                              hackystat-sensor-emacs/
                                                     sensor-package.el
                              hackystat-sensor-eclipse/
                                                       org.hackystat.sensor.eclipse_8.0.v20071101.jar
   :
   :
}}}

The README.html file simply points you to this page. 

Note that the version number, 8.0.1005, indicates the major release (8), the minor release (0), and the month/day of this build (1101, or November 1).                                                                  

At present, documentation snapshots are not packaged in these distributions. Instead, go to the online User Guides for details about each package.

=Using a System Distribution (for Developers)=

For developers, one benefit of the System Distribution is to simplify dependency management.  With one download, a developer can obtain recent binaries for lower-level services that can be used as the value of the HACKYSTAT_UTILITIES_HOME, HACKYSTAT_SENSORBASE_HOME, HACKYSTAT_DAILYPROJECTDATA_HOME, and HACKYSTAT_SENSORSHELL_HOME environment and classpath variables. For example, I added the following lines to my ~/.profile file in order to set up my environment to point to a recent System Distribution on my !MacBook Pro:

{{{
export HACKYSTAT_DIST_VERSION=8.0.1007
export HACKYSTAT_SENSORS_DIST_HOME=/Users/johnson/java/hackystat-$HACKYSTAT_DIST_VERSION-sensors-bin
export HACKYSTAT_SERVICES_DIST_HOME=/Users/johnson/java/hackystat-$HACKYSTAT_DIST_VERSION-services-bin

export HACKYSTAT_UTILITIES_HOME=$HACKYSTAT_SERVICES_DIST_HOME/hackystat-utilities
export HACKYSTAT_SENSORBASE_HOME=$HACKYSTAT_SERVICES_DIST_HOME/hackystat-sensorbase-uh
export HACKYSTAT_DAILYPROJECTDATA_HOME=$HACKYSTAT_SERVICES_DIST_HOME/hackystat-analysis-dailyprojectdata
export HACKYSTAT_SENSORSHELL_HOME=$HACKYSTAT_SENSORS_DIST_HOME/hackystat-sensor-shell
}}}

What makes this particularly convenient is that when a new System Distribution is released, I can download the binary distributions, unzip them, and then change only the first environment variable in order to update the pointers to all binaries.
