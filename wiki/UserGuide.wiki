= Introduction =

This page provides a guide to installing Hackystat from a "System Distribution" found in the [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat/downloads/list Downloads] area of this Google Project.  

A Hackystat "System Distribution" consists of a set of zip files with a common version number. Together, they provide a snapshot of all releasable Hackystat sensors and services built at one time and tested against each other whenever possible. It is possible to download and install individual Hackystat sensors and services by going to their individual Google Project Hosting pages, but most users (and developers) will find it more convenient and less failure-prone to download the most recent System Distribution and use that as the basis for their activities. 

= Structure of the System Distribution =

Currently, a Hackystat System distribution consists of two zip files. For example, the October 5, 2007 System Distribution consists of the following files:

 * hackystat-sensors-8.0.1005.zip
 * hackystat-services-8.0.1005.zip

Each of these files expands into a top-level directory with the same name as the file (except for the .zip suffix), with a subdirectory for each sensor or service contained within the distribution.  Each of these subdirectories contains a "dist/" and a "bin/" subdirectory, the "dist/" directory containing a "distribution" of the sources and the "bin/" directory containing one or more "binary" files. For example:

{{{
hackystat-sensors-8.0.1005/
                          README.html

                          hackystat-sensor-ant/
                                              dist/
                                                  hackystat-sensor-ant-8.0.1005.zip
                                              bin/
                                                 antsensors.jar

                          hackystat-sensor-emacs/
                                                dist/
                                                    hackystat-sensor-emacs-8.0.1005.zip
                                                bin/
                                                   sensor-package.el

   :

}}}

The README.html file simply points you to this page. The distribution zip files, if unzipped, would allow you to rebuild the sensor or service from scratch.  The services system distribution has the exact same internal structure as the sensors distribution.   

Note that the version number, 8.0.1005, indicates the major release (8), the minor release (0), and the month/day of this build (1005, or October 05).                                                                  

At present, documentation snapshots are not packaged in these distributions. Instead, go to the online User Guides for details about each package.

=Using a System Distribution (for Developers)=

For developers, the benefit of the System Distribution is to simplify dependency management.  With one download, a developer can obtain recent binaries for lower-level services that can be used as the value of the HACKYSTAT_UTILITIES_HOME, HACKYSTAT_SENSORBASE_HOME, and HACKYSTAT_SENSORSHELL_HOME environment and classpath variables. For example, the following lines set up these environment variables to point to the above System Distribution:

{{{
export HACKYSTAT_DISTRIBUTION_VERSION=8.0.1007
export HACKYSTAT_UTILITIES_HOME=/Users/johnson/java/hackystat-services-$HACKYSTAT_DISTRIBUTION_VERSION/hackystat-utilities/bin
export HACKYSTAT_SENSORBASE_HOME=/Users/johnson/java/hackystat-services-$HACKYSTAT_DISTRIBUTION_VERSION/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/bin
export HACKYSTAT_SENSORSHELL_HOME=/Users/johnson/java/hackystat-sensors-$HACKYSTAT_DISTRIBUTION_VERSION/hackystat-sensor-shell/bin
}}}

What makes this particularly convenient is that when a new System Distribution is released, the Developer can download it, unzip it, and then change only the first environment variable in order to update the pointers to all binaries.
