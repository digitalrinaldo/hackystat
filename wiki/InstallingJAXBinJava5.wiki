#summary How to install JAXB libraries in Java 5

Hackystat Version 8 is intended primarily for a Java 6 environment, in which JAXB libraries are provided in the core distribution.  However, we currently provide backward compatibility with Java 5 as long as the JAXB libraries are installed into your Java 5.  This page explains how to do this. 

== 1. Download the JAXB 2.0 libraries. ==

The JAXB libraries are available at: [https://jaxb.dev.java.net/ https://jaxb.dev.java.net/].

Please install a JAXB 2.0 release, not a JAXB 2.1 release, in order to be compatible with the version of JAXB distributed with Java 6. We recommend Release 2.0.5.

After downloading and unzipping, you should obtain a directory such as the following:

{{{
~/jaxb-ri-20070122/
}}}

It will contain a lib/ directory with the jar files that you will need to install.

== 2. Copy JAXB jar files to the {java}/lib/ext directory ==

To install JAXB, you need to copy the following four files from the JAXB/lib directory:

 * activation.jar (*see below*)
 * jaxb-api.jar
 * jaxb-impl.jar
 * jsr173_1.1_api.jar

*Note:* you have presumably already installed version 1.1 of the !JavaBeans Activation Framework as part of InstallingJavaMail, which is more recent than than the 1.0 version provided with JAXB, so you do not need to copy over the activation.jar file.

The location to which you copy these files depends upon your operating system.

|| *OS* || *Typical location of lib/ext directory* ||
|| Mac OS/X || /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK/Home/lib/ext  ||
|| Windows || C:\Java\jre1.5.0_7\lib\ext ||

Note that in Windows, you must be careful to install it in the "JRE" directory, not the "JDK" directory. On Mac OS X you will need to authenticate as an administrator to copy the files to the System area.

== 3. Verifying your installation ==

Unfortunately, we don't currently have a simple way to verify that you have installed JAXB correctly.  What we do know is that if you don't have JAXB installed, then Hackystat services like the [http://code.google.com/p/hackystat-sensorbase-uh/ SensorBase] will abort with the following error on startup:

{{{
admin01:~/svn-google/sensorbase-uh johnson$ java -jar sensorbase.jar 
/Users/johnson/.hackystat/sensorbase/sensorbase.properties not found. Using default sensorbase properties.
08/09 10:17:57  Derby: previously initialized.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/xml/bind/JAXBContext
        at org.hackystat.sensorbase.resource.sensordatatypes.SdtManager.<init>(SdtManager.java:87)
        at org.hackystat.sensorbase.server.Server.newInstance(Server.java:94)
        at org.hackystat.sensorbase.server.Server.main(Server.java:130)
}}}

So, one way to test your JAXB installation is to run the !SensorBase and see that this error does not occur.
