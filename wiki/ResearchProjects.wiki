In addition to the above, there are some smaller scale projects that would be interesting to do:

  * Provide a "native" .NET interface to Hackystat that would simplify the development of sensors for Visual Studio and other Microsoft products. (This could be something like a port of the SensorShell to C#).

  * Provide RSS integration using something like [https://rome.dev.java.net/ Rome].  It would be useful to support both "publishing" things like changes to the !SensorBase, as well as "subscribing"---in other words, a sensor that can listen to an RSS feed and generate sensor data based upon the feed.
